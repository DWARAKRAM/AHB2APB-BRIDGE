# AHB2APB-BRIDGE
<p align = "justify">An AMBA based microcontroller typically consists of a high performance system backbone bus(AMBA AHB or AMBA ASB), able to sustain the external memory bandwidth on which CPU, on-chip memory and other Director Memory Access(DMA) devices reside. This bus provides a high bandwidth interface between the elements that are involved in the majority of transfers. Also located on the high-performance bus is a bridge to the lower bandwidth bus APB, where most of the peripheral devices in the system are located.</p>
